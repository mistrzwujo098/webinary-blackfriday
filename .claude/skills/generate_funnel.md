## Quality Check
- [ ] Is audience type (B2B/B2C) correctly identified?
- [ ] Does entire funnel have cohesive message?
- [ ] Is belief shift present in LP and emails?
- [ ] Are emails balanced (value vs pitch)?
- [ ] Is urgency ethical (if used)?
- [ ] Are all CTAs benefit-oriented?
- [ ] Does thank you page reduce buyer's remorse?
- [ ] Is A/B test plan specific and measurable?

Remember: Funnel is SYSTEM, not collection of isolated pieces. Each element must smoothly lead to next. Message consistency from ad through thank you page is critical. Always prioritize long-term customer relationship over single conversion.

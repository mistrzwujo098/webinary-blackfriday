```

- Create offers so good people feel stupid saying no

**Pillar 1: Availability**
- Answer every channel (phone, email, text, social)
- Be omnipresent where your leads are
- Multiple touchpoints increase conversion

**Pillar 2: Speed**

- Track and optimize each metric

### 4. LIFETIME VALUE (Crazy Eight Framework)

**Formula:** LTV = Gross Profit per Transaction × Number of Transactions

**8 Ways to Increase LTV:**

1. **Raise Prices** - Test 5-20% increases, most businesses are underpriced
2. **Lower Costs** - Negotiate with suppliers, improve efficiency
3. **Upsells** - Offer premium versions at point of sale
4. **Downsells** - Capture "no" customers with lower-priced options
5. **Cross-sells** - Complementary products/services
6. **Increase Purchase Frequency** - Create reasons to buy more often
7. **Bring Back Lost Customers** - Winback campaigns for churned clients
8. **Reduce Churn** - Fix the "5 Horsemen of Churn"

**The 5 Horsemen of Churn:**
1. Poor onboarding (first 48 hours critical)
2. Lack of engagement
3. No quick wins
4. Unclear value delivery
5. Broken promises

### 5. MARKETING MACHINE

**Core Components:**

**Hooks Assembly:**
- Pain hooks (call out problems)

- Curiosity hooks (create information gap)
- Proof hooks (show results)

**Lead Generation Hierarchy:**
1. Warm Outreach (existing network)
2. Cold Outreach (targeted prospects)
3. Free Content (build audience)
4. Paid Ads (scale what works)

**Content Strategy (70-20-10 Rule):**
- 70% Educational/valuable content

**Ad Framework:**

- State the problem (what they're struggling with)
- Show the solution (your offer)
- Provide proof (results/testimonials)
- CTA (clear next step)

### 6. PRICING STRATEGIES

**Pricing Principles:**
- Price on value delivered, not cost to deliver
- Higher prices = better clients + more resources to deliver
- Test price increases regularly (5-10% quarterly)
- Use pricing to filter customers

**Price Raise Playbook:**
- Grandfather existing clients (build goodwill)
- Communicate value first, price second
- Give advance notice (30-60 days)
- Offer incentives for annual prepay

**Three Pricing Tiers:**
- Entry (accessible, proven offer)
- Premium (best value, most popular)
- Elite (exclusive, transformational)

### 7. SALES & CLOSING

**BAMFAM Framework** (Book A Meeting From A Meeting):
- Every interaction should book the next one
- Never end without a clear next step
- Reduce time between touchpoints

**Objection Handling:**
- "I need to think about it" → Isolate the real concern
- "It's too expensive" → Show ROI and payment plans
- "I need to talk to spouse" → Get them on the call
- "Not the right time" → Create urgency through scarcity

**Closing Framework:**
1. Build rapport
2. Isolate pain
3. Amplify consequences of inaction
4. Present solution tied to their specific pain
5. Handle objections
6. Ask for the sale
7. Close or book next step

- Progress tracking and celebration
- Community building
- Continued education

**Churn Prevention:**

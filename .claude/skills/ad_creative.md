## Copy Optimization Checklist

### HOOK (First 3-5 Words)
- [ ] Scroll-stopping (question, bold claim, pain callout)
- [ ] Relevant to audience
- [ ] Creates curiosity or urgency
- [ ] Works without image (for sound-off viewing)

### BODY (Middle Section)
- [ ] Agitates problem OR showcases dream outcome

- [ ] Includes specific benefit with number/result
- [ ] Short sentences, scannable
- [ ] Conversational tone

### CTA (Last Line + Button)
- [ ] Clear action (click, sign up, shop, download)
- [ ] Benefit-oriented ("Get free guide" not "Submit")
- [ ] Low friction (free, no card, instant access)
- [ ] Creates urgency if appropriate

### OVERALL
- [ ] Mobile-optimized (looks good on phone)

## A/B Testing Strategy

**Test Variables (One at a Time)**:
1. **Hook type**: Question vs statement vs stat
2. **Benefit framing**: Feature vs outcome vs transformation
3. **CTA**: Soft ("Learn more") vs direct ("Buy now")
4. **Length**: Short (50 words) vs long (150+ words)
5. **Social proof**: With vs without testimonial
6. **Visual**: Product vs lifestyle vs UGC (user-generated)

**Winning Ad Formula** (Once Found):
- Scale budget to 80% of total
- Create 3 variations of winner
- Continue testing 20% budget on new angles

### AD BRIEF
- Product: [Name]
- Audience: [Demographics + psychographics]
- Platform: [FB/IG/Google/LI]

### TESTING RECOMMENDATION
**Start with**: Variant [A/B/C]
**Why**: [Most aligned with cold/warm audience stage]
**Metrics to watch**: CTR (target: >2%), CPC (target: <X PLN), Conv Rate

---

## Usage Example

User: "Create Facebook ad for Instagram course for hairdressers, 997 PLN, cold traffic"

Output:
- 3 ad variants (question hook, stat hook, story hook)
- Each with primary text, headline, description, CTA, visual concept
- Platform-optimized for FB feed
- Cold traffic messaging (awareness stage, not hard sell)
- Testing recommendation

---

## Quality Check
- [ ] Does hook stop scroll in first 3 words?
- [ ] Is benefit specific (not vague)?
- [ ] Does it match audience temperature (cold/warm/hot)?
- [ ] Is CTA clear and low-friction?
- [ ] Would I click this ad myself?
- [ ] Is copy optimized for platform limits?
- [ ] Does visual concept amplify (not repeat) copy?

Remember: Ad creative is FIRST touchpoint with customer. Make it count. Pattern interrupt → Benefit → CTA. Never boring, never vague, never unclear. Test relentlessly - winners emerge from volume of variants.
